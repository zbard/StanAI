    The transition model is not entirely stationary: it may depend on Pacman's
    current position (e.g., for DirectionalGhost).  However, this is not a problem,
    as Pacman's current position is known.

    In order to obtain the distribution over new positions for the
    ghost, given its previous position (oldPos) as well as Pacman's
    current position, use this line of code:

      newPosDist = self.getPositionDistribution(self.setGhostPosition(gameState, oldPos))

    Note that you may need to replace "oldPos" with the correct name
    of the variable that you have used to refer to the previous ghost
    position for which you are computing this distribution.

    newPosDist is a util.Counter object, where for each position p in self.legalPositions,
    
    newPostDist[p] = Pr( ghost is at position p at time t + 1 | ghost is at position oldPos at time t )

    (and also given Pacman's current position).  You may also find it useful to loop over key, value pairs
    in newPosDist, like:

      for newPos, prob in newPosDist.items():
        ...

    As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern
    yourself), the line of code above for obtaining newPosDist makes
    use of two helper methods provided in InferenceModule above:

      1) self.setGhostPosition(gameState, ghostPosition)
          This method alters the gameState by placing the ghost we're tracking
          in a particular position.  This altered gameState can be used to query
          what the ghost would do in this position.
      
      2) self.getPositionDistribution(gameState)
          This method uses the ghost agent to determine what positions the ghost
          will move to from the provided gameState.  The ghost must be placed
          in the gameState with a call to self.setGhostPosition above.
